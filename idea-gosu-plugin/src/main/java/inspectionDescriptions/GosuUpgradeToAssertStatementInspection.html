Reports wrong usages of the "assert" keyword.
<!-- tooltip end -->
This inspection allows you to upgrade your code so that it will not conflict with the new assert statement added in Gosu.
The inspection simply replace all the occurrences of the word "assert" with "_assert_".
<p>
    Note that under normal circumstances this inspection should be disabled as it was designed to be run just for the upgrade process.
    If you add assert statements in your code and then run this inspection, they will be erroneously marked as wrong usages
