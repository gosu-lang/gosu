Upgrade Gosu code that was using a plain numeric expression in place of a interval in the for statement. <br>
<!-- tooltip end -->
Gosu does not support numeric expressions in the for statement after the "in" keyword.<br>
The code for(x in <b>10</b>) {...} is illegal and will be upgraded with an interval like this: for(x in <b>0..|10</b>) {...}
<p>
    Note that under normal circumstances this inspection should be disabled as it was designed to be run just for the upgrade process.
